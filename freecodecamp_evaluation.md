__License:__ [License](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

__Is it [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) license:__   
Yes, they are using the 3-Clause BSD License.

__URL for contributing instructions:__ [Contributing instructions](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

__Are the contributing instructions clear?__ 
The contributing instructions redirect me to the contribute guide on their website, which is clear with guides for different types of contributions (help others, feedback, translations, write code).

__URL for code of conduct / community norms / community guildelines:__ [Community Guidelines](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

__URL for instructions for users to download and install the package:__   
I don't think download and installation is necessary for FreeCodeCamp because the code is running live at [freeCodeCamp.org](freeCodeCamp.org) Installation is for developers only.


__Are these instructions clear? Do you think they would be easy to follow?__ N/A


__URL for instructions for how to install development environment:__ [Setup a dev environment for freeCodeCamp](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally/)


__Are these instruction clear? Do you think they would be easy to follow?__  
Yes the instructions are clear and easy to follow. However setting up FreeCodeCamp has certain requirements for the local machine, so not every user is able to follow the guide and set up.

- __are there issues marked "good for newbies", "beginner" or some other indicators that imply that they are good for beginner contributors:__ 

    - __how many of such issues are there?__ [first timers only: 908 issues](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20label%3A%22first%20timers%20only%22)
    
    - __look at a few of them, do they look beginner friendly?__   
    I believe they are beginner-friendly because many of them can be solved with only 1-2 lines of code.



- __are there issues marked "documentation" or some other indicators that imply that they are documentation (user or developer specific):__   
No. I believe this is because FreeCodeCamp is an educational website itself so a great portion of contributions are document contributions. It's unnecessary to set a document label.

    - __look at a few of them, do you think you could submit a fix?__ N/A
