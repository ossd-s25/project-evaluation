## Development Environment 

Each member of your group should attempt to configure the development environment 
for this project. Complete the following for each member:

Name: Brizen Britt

Operating system: MacOS

Was the installation successful? (if not, explain what went wrong and 
what you did to try to remedy it) No, I decided not to finish installation because the instructions required too many dependencies to be downloaded.

How long did the whole process take? If I continued I believe the process would take over an hour.
