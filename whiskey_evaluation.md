## Finding info about contributing on the website.


In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.


__Project website:__ [Website](https://getwhisky.app/)

__What is the purpose of the project:__
The purpose of the project is to allow users to easily run Windows apps and games on macOS with Wine and Apple's Game Porting Toolkit, without having to deal with the command line interface or dealing with installing a Windows VM on macOS.


__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__
It was slightly hard to find the contributing information on the website. We had to go on the GitHub link from the main website, and then find the actual `CONTRIBUTING.md` file amongst the file tree in the GitHub repo (though fortunately, it was in the root directory).

__URL for the code repository:__ [Code repository](https://github.com/Whisky-App/Whisky)

   - __when was the issue closed:__ 2/5/2025


- __how active is the discussion on the issues:__
It's wildly all over the place, depending on the popularity of the software that Whiskey users are trying to emulate. There are issues that have a lot of good discussion just because the software is pretty popular, and there are issues that don't really get much discussion just because of how the software is less popular.

   - __example of a lot of good discussion:__ [Good discussion](https://github.com/Whisky-App/Whisky/issues/1199)
  
   - __example of an issue that does not have much discussion:__ [Not much discussion](https://github.com/Whisky-App/Whisky/issues/1323)


- __are there issues marked "good for newbies", "beginner" or some other indicators that imply that they are good for beginner contributors:__ No, although labels are available


   - __how many of such issues are there?__ 0 issues
  
   - __look at a few of them, do they look beginner friendly?__ No


- __are there issues marked "documentation" or some other indicators that imply that they are documentation (user or developer specific):__ Not in the main software repo, but there is a [Whiskey documentation repo](https://github.com/Whisky-App/whisky-book/issues)


   - __how many of such issues are there?__ 5 open
  
   - __look at a few of them, do you think you could submit a fix?__ Relatively easy, although given the same issues as the main repo in terms of only one person working on the issue, it might be hard to collaborate.


__Pull requests__


- __how many open pull requests are there:__ 7


   - __url for the last pull request created:__ [Last Pull Request created](https://github.com/Whisky-App/Whisky/pull/1308)

## Development Environment


Each member of your group should attempt to configure the development environment for this project. Complete the following for each member:


Member 1: Arnav 


Operating system: MacOS Sequoia 15.3.1


Was the installation successful? (if not, explain what went wrong and
what you did to try to remedy it) yes it was


How long did the whole process take? About 5 minutes


Member 2: Jahleel


Operating system: macOS Sequoia 15.1


Was the installation successful? (if not, explain what went wrong and
what you did to try to remedy it): Yes


How long did the whole process take? The whole installation process took roughly 3 minutes for the actual downloading. Maybe about half a minute for forking the project before cloning. 


Member 3: Andy


Operating system: macOS Sequoia 15.3.1


Was the installation successful? (if not, explain what went wrong and
what you did to try to remedy it) Yes


How long did the whole process take? 5 minutes via the Open with Xcode button on GitHub, given that I had to reinstall some Xcode files that were cleared out between OS updates. I did have to create a new branch before actually getting to work though.

## Summary assessment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
The project is not very friendly to beginner contributors in the sense that there is one person that has done ~88% of the project’s commits. This makes it difficult for some people to end up contributing to the project, as there isn't much of a structure in terms of getting new contributors used to the project.

(The documentation would be relatively easy to contribute, but mainly only for listing games that work (or not) on specific hardware combinations.)


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Yes, though the actual lead maintainer has been absent in the actual issues page as of late. They are more available in the 

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

For the most part, the people are friendly in both the Discord, discussion forums, and issues?


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
For documentation, yes, as long as it's just a listing games that work or don't work pull request.

For the actual software itself, this is not the case as of late (as pull request reviews have been pretty slow, and it seems like the lead contributor has kind of stopped making commits to the project).


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
No


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
For the software frontend, knowledge of SwiftUI and Swift would be necessary, although this would be relatively easy to learn and understand. However, for the software backend, some knowledge is required to basically understand lower level codes and commands to figure out why a piece of external software code is breaking (and there's a chance that you might need to deal with Wine stuff, which isn't what you want to sign up for!).

For the documentation, no special skills are required for game listing. Some undocumented troubleshooting skills may be required otherwise.

__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
Yes, users will need to use a Mac computer that supports at least macOS Sonoma in order to contribute and test the software.
