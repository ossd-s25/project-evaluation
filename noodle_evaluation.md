## Development Environment 

Each member of your group should attempt to configure the development environemnt 
for this project. Complete the following for each member:

Name: Jack Tinker

Operating system: MacOS

Was the installation successful? (if not, explain what went wrong and 
what you did to try to remedy it) No. The installation guide requires you to install a package manager called "Bun". I tried this multiple times but my installation never seemed to "stick"- my machine never actually was able to find the installed package manager.

How long did the whole process take? Around 2 minutes before I got stuck, then around 5 minutes troubleshooting.

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
The community seems friendly, but it seems like there is only one person running the whole show, and the project is in very early stages of development. There is no functional product yet.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
Yes, but I do wonder if that is still the case. The main contributor hasn't made a new commit in months, and issues roll in very rarely.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
Yes, but there isn't a lot of activity. I couldn't find any activity in the Discord from 2025.



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
No.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
Yes!


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
There is a long list of tools that Noodle relies on. I am not sure how hard it would be to learn these for a beginner.


__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
Not that I know of.
