## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ Very friendly, however it seems that discussion and issues have slowed since the beginning of this year. For those who want to learn Typescript in a low stakes environment this might be a good choice. Contributors can even request a pairing (Zoom/Google Hangouts) to pair with a maintainer on tackling an issue.




__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ They do give good suggestions/fixes.



__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ Yes they seem friendly.




__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Yes they have more pull requests closed than they do open. I would say the open pull requests that are older were not accepted for a reason.



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ Yes.



__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ No.



__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

node, pnpm, and the Netlify CLI are required.
