## Development Environment 

Each member of your group should attempt to configure the development environemnt 
for this project. Complete the following for each member:

Name: Justin Chen

Operating system: Windows (11)

Was the installation successful? (if not, explain what went wrong and 
what you did to try to remedy it): Yes, it was successful. I installed the desktop integration version using a prebuilt .exe. This is th editor that functions as the Godot project manager for creating, importing, and opening existing Godot projects. Then I tried installing the build source to compile Godot myself (for modifying code and build). Once I cloned the repository, I needed to install SCons, which is an open-source software construction tool (easier and faster to build the project software). I did run into a small issue where I couldn't install SCons, but that was because I did not have Python installed. Once it was, I tried again to setup the SCons build system to compile Godot for Windows. BUT, ran into another issue... I couldn't find the executable to open the build. Turns out I didn't hav ea valid compiler and so the SCons build was unsuccessful. I had to install Microsoft Visual Studio build tools, desktop development package for C++, and Windows SDK. And then finally I try running the SCons build again in the Godot directory to compile Godot. Ran into another issue--turns out I need to use the x64 Native Tools command Prompt for VS. At my first attempt to build, it defaulted to building a x32-bit version of Godot. I had to force set it to build a x64 version of Godot and it finally compiled (took quite a bit of time to build).

How long did the whole process take? 

This took about 1.5 hours.

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

This project is not very beginner friendly. It has quite a bit of documentation and technical jargon. This project definetly requires a lot of pre-existing knowledge of the game engine in order to get adjusted to contrbuting.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

Yes. The responses to issue requests are generally quite respectful and detailed with attached hyperlinks and images for reference to the issues.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

Yes, they are. Upon examining some discussion in the forum, the chat is filled with people always looking to help out. The responses are always useful and encourages further discussions. If anyone makes a mistake (e.g. not following style or code guidelines), a gentle reminder is always given to followi t.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Yes, there are tens of thousands of pull requests that have already been tagged, reviewed, and closed. There is about another ten thousand pull requests are are currently being discussed, reviewed, and remain open.

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

Yes they do. They also provide encouragements to fellow contributors to boost morale. When multiple people are working on the same issue, lots of evidence and solutions are provided and thoroughly tested by contributors. The issues develop sto fruition on their own, with people acknolwedging when vital information, fixes, and progress are made. 

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

Yes. Knoweledge of the engine, Godot's own built-in scripting language called GDScript, C# (in .NET version as alternative to GDScript), and C++. Also, developing good documentation and discussion skills is also vital to resolving issues efficiently (especially when multiple contributors are working on the same issue).

__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

Yes. The development device must be Vulkan 1.0 hardware compatable along with OpenGl 3.3 / OpenGL ES 3.0 compatable hardware. There are also additional requirements for the .NET version.
