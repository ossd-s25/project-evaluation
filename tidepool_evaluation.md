__What is the purpose of the project:__ Tidepool is a nonprofit organization that develops open-source software to help people with diabetes manage their condition more effectively. Its primary goal is to provide a user-friendly platform for collecting, visualizing, and analyzing diabetes data from various devices, such as continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), insulin pumps, and blood glucose meters. By offering a centralized, cloud-based solution, Tidepool empowers individuals, caregivers, and healthcare providers to make more informed decisions about diabetes management. Additionally, the organization advocates for data interoperability and patient access to health information, fostering innovation in diabetes care through collaboration with device manufacturers and the broader diabetes community.
