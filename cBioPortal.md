__URL for instructions for users to download and install the package:__  [here](https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/blob/master/docs/Downloads.md). 


__Are these instructions clear? Do you think they would be easy to follow?__ 
The instructions provided in the official cBioPortal documentation appear to be detailed and comprehensive, covering user downloads, installation, and development environment setup. However, their clarity and ease of following depend on the user's technical background:

For general users who just want to download and explore the data, the instructions on the Downloads page seem straightforward and easy to follow. The steps for accessing data through the website or API are clearly outlined.

For developers or those setting up a local instance, the Deployment-Procedure and Docker installation instructions require some familiarity with Linux, Docker, and web services. While the steps are well-documented, beginners might find them a bit challenging to execute without prior experience in deploying software or using command-line tools.
