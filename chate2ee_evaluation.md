## Development Environment

for this project. Complete the following for each member:

Name: Vasily B

Operating system: macOS 15.3.1

Was the installation successful? (if not, explain what went wrong and 
what you did to try to remedy it) Yes! This is a MERN stack project, and there are clear instructions on how to get MongoDB to work if you need it. However, for front-end development, it is enough to just clone the project to your computer and install the dependencies.

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

This project is __somewhat friendly__ for beginner contributors because there have been many issues in the past related to styling, editing text, or adding small features to the front-end.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

Yes, the project's owner responds quickly and guides contributors. For example, [this](https://github.com/muke1908/chat-e2ee/issues/287) contributor had trouble setting up the development environment, and the owner helped them.

However, [here](https://github.com/muke1908/chat-e2ee/pull/375), the maintainer tried to help the contributor but it seems like the PR was closed anyway due to multiple errors in the code. For example, the maintainer asked the contributor not to hard code the URLs, but it would be helpful to know that beforehand if there were a styling/formatting guide.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

Yes. Many of them write in somewhat broken English but they are still polite and on point.

__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

They get reviewed by the maintainer.

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

Sometimes.

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

* React.js and TypeScript
* knowledge of how to write unit tests (if contributing to unit tests)
* knowledge of how encryption works (if contributing to backend)

__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

* Have Docker and MongoDB set up (if contributing to backend)
