## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

I wouldn't say this is the most friendly project for beginners if you have never used this tool before, since there seems to be a lot of syntax and code structure you have to understand in order to contribute; there also aren't that many open issues labeled under "GoodFirstIssue".


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

Yes, one pro is that maintainers seem to be highly responsive.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

Yes, people are quite friendly.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Yes, pull requests get reviewed on a regular basis. 


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

No, they are just given a thumbs up.

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

Nothing in particular, but you probably need a solid understanding of this tool's ins and outs. 


__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

No.
