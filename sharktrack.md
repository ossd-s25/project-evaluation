## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ Not very friendly. If one could get in touch with the founders of the project, through the email they provide, then it could be potentially beginner friendly since it is all in Python and does not have a very large code base. If this is not possible, however, then it would be very hard to meaningfully contribute to this project.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ N/A




__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ N/A



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ No



__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ Tech Background/Development Experience. Proficiency in machine learning and python.



__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ No, just need to install the required packages, environment, etc.
