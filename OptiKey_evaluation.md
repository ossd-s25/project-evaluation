## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__ [Website](https://www.optikey.org)


__What is the purpose of the project:__ OptiKey is an on-screen keyboard that is designed to help Motor Neuron Disease (MND) patients interact with Windows computers. When used with an eye-tracking device, OptiKey's on-screen keyboard allows MND patients to complete tasks, such as email composition, using only their eyes. OptiKey can also be used with a mouse or webcam. Unlike expensive and unreliable Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) products that are difficult to use, Optikey is free, reliable, and easy to use.


__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__ There is a contribute page [Contribute](https://github.com/OptiKey/OptiKey/wiki/Contribute) right in its README file.

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

While the contributing instructions are clear and easy to follow, there are no issues or labels specifically indicating “good for newbies.” This suggests that although the project welcomes contributions, it might not have tailored entry points or specially curated tasks for beginners.

__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

Based on the issue and pull request activity, responses from maintainers appear to be prompt—especially in pull requests. However, overall discussion in issues tends to be minimal, so while responses may be helpful when they occur, there is limited ongoing dialogue.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

There isn’t extensive evidence of community discussion beyond the GitHub issue pages. The interactions that are visible suggest a respectful tone, but the relative lack of extended discussion makes it difficult to fully assess the community’s overall friendliness.

__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Yes. With a significant number of pull requests submitted and many being reviewed (with evidence of discussion in both recent and older PRs), it appears that contributions are being given attention through code review.

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

There’s no explicit mention of thank-you messages in the summary provided. However, the generally positive tone of the repository and the active management of pull requests suggest that maintainers likely express gratitude in interactions, even if it isn’t systematically documented.

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

Yes. Since the project is primarily developed in C# and targets Windows environments, contributors should have familiarity with C# programming and Windows application development. Experience with accessibility technologies (e.g., eye-tracking integration) may also be beneficial.

__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

Contributing to this project might require access to a Windows development environment because the software is designed specifically for Windows. Additionally, for testing accessibility features, having access to hardware such as an eye-tracking device (or related peripherals) would be useful.
