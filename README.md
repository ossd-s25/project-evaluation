# project-evaluation-activity

In this activity, you will evaluate an open-source project.

You should be working with your assigned partner (or two). 

Create a new file in this repository and copy the template from the `template_evaluation.md` into it.
You should name the file by replacing the word "template" in the template with the name of the project you are looking at. 

Answer all the questions in the template based on the information on the project website and in the project repository (DO NOT use a search engine!!!).  Make sure that your answers are formatted in a readable way. Look at the resulting file, not just the markdown source file.
