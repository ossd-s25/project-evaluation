It's a work-in-progress customized firmware for the Nintendo Switch.

It was a little challenging. You had to go to the Issues section first, which then linking to a 
general open source guide. There was no CONTRIBUTING.md file.

__License:__ [License](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/blob/master/LICENSE)

__Is it [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) license:__ Yes.

__Programming Language(s):__ C++, C, Makefile, Assembly

__URL for contributing instructions:__ [Contributing instructions](https://opensource.guide/)

__Are the contributing instructions clear?__ 

Not really. The wensite that is linked to is very broad in its scope, and the repo doesn't
really direct you to a specific guide. And even if it did, the recommendations are broad
and not project-specific.

__URL for code of conduct / community norms / community guildelines:__ [Community Guidelines](https://opensource.guide/)

There isn't any explicit code of conduct file or link. Charitably, the contruibuting guidelines website does have
some info about what proper conduct looks like, but the repo makes no direct mention to them or ask contributers to 
follow them.

__URL for instructions for users to download and install the package:__  [here](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/blob/master/docs/building.md). 


__Are these instructions clear? Do you think they would be easy to follow?__ 

Yes it is clear, but there is no troubleshooting section. Seems to assume some familiarity with required tools. 

__URL for instructions for how to install development environment:__ [here](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/blob/master/docs/building.md)


__Are these instruction clear? Do you think they would be easy to follow?__

Sort of? There's no explicit dev environment instructions, so the assumption is that a contributer can just install
the tools and is ready to go.
