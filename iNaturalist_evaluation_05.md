## Development Environment 

Each member of your group should attempt to configure the development environemnt 
for this project. Complete the following for each member:

Name: Stella Zhang

Operating system: Windows 11

Was the installation successful? (if not, explain what went wrong and 
what you did to try to remedy it)

I did not manage to successfully install it - I ran into an issue with Postgres credentials. However, I saw in the project evaluation that a classmate has managed to set it up on Windows 11 and I plan to ask them.

How long did the whole process take? 
I spent 3 hours before deciding to seek help when I actually begin contributing.
