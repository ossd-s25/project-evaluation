## Summary assessment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

Relatively not friendly for beginners. Kind of annoying to have to redo the build process for any revisions you want to do.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

Somewhat helpfully, but I don't think it's helpful enough

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

I would say this is a so-so


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Yes

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

No, but most PRs contributed are made by the actual contributors themselves

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

Yes, you should probably have some experience with the science involved in diabetes to understand what's going on.

__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

You need a Mac computer that is running at least macOS 14, and the latest version of Xcode installed.
