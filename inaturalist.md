## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__ I'd say its somewhat friendly. It has a large amount of issues and is a large enough where there are various features to add to. The issue with this is that there is a large codebase, and potential contributors would need to sort of play "catch-up" to understand what they are really doing. If a beginner wants to fix something simple without necessarily understanding the entire platform, there are issues labeled easy just for this.




__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ Yes



__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ Yes




__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Yes



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ No



__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ Tech background, but there are some issues that are fairly simple, so nothing crazy.



__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__ No, just need to install the required packages, environment, etc.
