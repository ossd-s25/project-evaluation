## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__ Luma3DS doesn't have a dedicated website. This is their [GitHub](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS?tab=readme-ov-file).


__What is the purpose of the project:__ Luma3DS is a custom firmware for Nintendo 3DS consoles to add features and enable homebrew applications.


__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__ Hard. I was unable to find any instructions on how to contribute to the project.


__Contributing instructions:__ A brief comment on contributions can be found in the [Wiki] (https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/wiki).

__URL for the code repository:__ [GitHub](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS?tab=readme-ov-file)

__Bug/Issue tracker link:__ [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/issues)

__Mailing list:__ No mailing list given.

__Chat channel:__ [3DS Homebrew Discord](https://discord.gg/C29hYvh). (Not exclusively for Luma3DS, but this is the communication channel linked in their wiki, and I have seen some of the project maintainers active here)

__Other communication channels:__ N/A

## Finding info at the project repository and bug/issue tracker.

__License:__ [GPL-3.0 License](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/blob/master/LICENSE)

__Is it [OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) license:__ Yes! They use the GPL-3.0 License.

__Programming Language(s):__ Majority C, some C++, some Assembly

__URL for contributing instructions:__ on the [Wiki](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/wiki).

__Are the contributing instructions clear?__ They are extremely brief. They aren't confusing, but they don't really give any insight on where to get started with the project.


__URL for code of conduct / community norms / community guildelines:__ There are no rules posted on GitHub, but there are community rules on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/C29hYvh).

__URL for instructions for users to download and install the package:__  Luma3DS provides [this guide in their Wiki](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/wiki/Installation-and-upgrade), but they admit they have let it get outdated. Probably because [3ds.hacks.guide](3ds.hacks.guide) does it much better.


__Are these instructions clear? Do you think they would be easy to follow?__ The instructions on the Wiki are confusing, particularly for someone not familiar with all the tools involved in 3DS hacking. 3ds.hacks.guide is very easy to follow, though.


__URL for instructions for how to install development environment:__ The [README](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/blob/master/README.md) contains instructions to compile the package from source code, and the necessary dependencies. There is nothing specific to installing a development environment, though.


__Are these instruction clear? Do you think they would be easy to follow?__ I think they would be a bit hard to follow. They ask you to visit and install other, separate projects, so I can see there being some roadblocks with that.

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
This project is not friendly to beginner contributors.



__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
The contributors don't seem terribly interested in taking contributions from outsiders at the moment- they appear to be in a stage of development where the core contributors are working closely together to make improvements.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
Yes, they seem friendly. The Discord mostly seems focused on the user community, though, not the developer community.



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Not formally, but I think they are being informally reviewed.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
Not publically.


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
Yes. You need an understanding of firmwares, how the 3DS works, and the entire 3DS modding tech stack.


__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
I would imagine that it would be nice to have a 3DS so that you can test out the custom firmware, look for issues, and test if your fixes are working.
