## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

Currently it is not very friendly for beginner contributors considering there are no open issues for the beginner contributer label. There are some issues that are labeled p1, meaning it is not related to the code. In that sense, I believe I can contribute, but I would also like to be able to contribute to the code.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

It seems like they do at least sometimes. Some issues have great discussion while others have absolutely no discussion. 

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

The people are not necessarily super friendly in discussions of issues so much as it feels like direct or business-like conversation. The environment is slightly friendlier in the discord channel. 


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Pull requests do get reviewed. Not necessarily every day, but fairly frequently as the scale of the project is quite large. 

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

No. This does not seem to happen. 

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

At least in terms of a list, there are none that are required to contribute to the project. This is probably partially due to the variation in types of contribution, with some of them being at a level that even non-programmers could contribute to.

__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

There are some software requirements, including Node version 22.14.0, pnpm 10.4.1, and @antfu/ni 23.3.1. To install pnpm I had to install corepack, but that was not a listed requirement.
