__Project website:__ [Huggingface Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)


__What is the purpose of the project:__ 
> HF Transformers provides APIs and tools to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models. Using pretrained models can reduce your compute costs, carbon footprint, and save you the time and resources required to train a model from scratch. These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as:

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__  
Not so friendly, because some knowledge in the implementation of Machine Learning models is a must for contributing to this projects.



__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__  
Yes they do. Most issues have very helpful and detailed responses. 


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
I believe the people are quite friendly, because the issues from beginners are resolved with patience and detailed explanations.



__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Yes they do.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
Sometimes they do (if the PRs are helpful and get merged, or, the responses are issues are useful).


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__   
The 2 skills required to contribute to the project are: Python programming and knowledge in ML implementation. Some knowledge in GPU acceleration is preferred.


__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__  
Preferrably the contributors should have access to some computing resources (i.e., GPUs with adequate VRAM) because they need to test their contributions, which often involves running a large ML model.
