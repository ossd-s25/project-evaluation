## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__
This project seems challenging for a beginner contributor. This due to the technical machine learning background required for most contributions, and also due to the culture we observed in the community. While no one seems "mean", the culture doesn't seem very beginner friendly. All discussions are inundated with technical jargon, and the "easy" tag appears to be pretty much defunct. That being said, there is a very large community and a wealth of detailed documentation, so to someone interested in machine learning, it seems like a decent, if challenging, candidate.

__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__
The maintainers give respectful responses, but they don't come off as especially friendly, and they are not speaking in beginner-friendly language. We rarely saw "thank you" used in issues and PRs.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__
In our experience, everyone seemed to be respectful, but very matter-of-fact about things. Nothing indicated to us a strong sense of community.

__Do pull requests get reviewed?__
Yes. There is a robust system that assigns teams of reviewers based on the topic of the PR.


__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__
Rarely.


__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
Yes. Most contributions would require knowledge of machine learning/neural networks.


__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__
One of PyTorch's main features is GPU hardware acceleration. Without a GPU-enabled machine, I imagine many GPU-related issues would be challenging to help fix.
