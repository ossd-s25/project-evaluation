## Summary assessment

__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__  
If you stick to documentation and 'newbie' issues, it seems fairly beginner friendly.

__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__  
Yes, they are helpful and pretty quick.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__  
People seem friendly from what I've seen.  

__Do pull requests get reviewed?__  
Every single one gets reviewed.

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__  
Yes.  

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__  
Beyond deocumentation contributions, the only "special" skill needed for code contributions is Perl. I'm assuming that things like HTML and JS are pretty 'common' skills.

__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__  
Obviously Git, but Docker is required as well.
