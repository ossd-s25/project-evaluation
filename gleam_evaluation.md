Yes.

Yes.

__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Yes.

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

Yes.

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

Yes. Namely a background in compilers.

__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

No.
