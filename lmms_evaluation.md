---

Name: Jared

Operating system: Windows 10

Was the installation successful? (if not, explain what went wrong and 
what you did to try to remedy it)

My installation was not successful because I was getting many errors, and I also had to do many workarounds because I’m using Windows and not Linux.

The process took around 20 minutes, although I haven’t fixed the errors.

Operating system: MacOS

Was the installation successful? (if not, explain what went wrong and

No, when I tried to follow the directions, starting from scratch, there seems to be a lot of libraries and softwares that need to be installed on the operating system.

I tried to install it for around 15 minutes, but was unsuccessful.

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

This project could be great for beginners, but the biggest challenge is the installation. It is more difficult for users not using Linux, and especially for Windows.

__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

The maintainers are responsive when it comes to issues and they try their best to help out.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

We haven't checked their Discord yet, but the discussion form has a lot of people who discuss issue and seem to be friendly.

__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Yes, pull requests definitely get reviewed on a regular basis. The maintainers seems relatively active.

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

No, we don’t see that.

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

I would say the person working on the project should understand basic music concepts and have a solid understanding of how the LLMS software works in order to contribute to the file. 

__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

Virtualizing a Linux instance is strongly recommended, since the author suggests that building LMMS could be difficult on Windows.
