## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

I would say that aside from there being no open issues for beginner contributers and the lack of discussion on issues that were opened today, the project is fairly beginner friendly. 


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

At the very least, they do not respond quickly to questions in issues. Most issues have very little discussion.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__

I looked at a couple of discussions in the Discord and some of the conversations seemed tense

__Do pull requests get reviewed?__

Pull requests do get reviewed pretty frequently. There are many recently closed pull requests.

__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__

Yes, they do thank people for their contributions. 

__Are there special skills required to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

Considering the scale or complexity of some of the issues I saw in the repository, I would say special skills are not particularly required. 

__Are there any special hardware/software requirements to be able to contribute to the project? If so, what are they?__

If someone is only trying to do a one-time contribution, it is recommended to use a Cloud IDE and in that case, there are no special hardware/software requirements as those will be provided by the Cloud IDE's environment.
